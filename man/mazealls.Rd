\description{
Generate recursive mazes.
}
\details{
Recursive generation of mazes proceeds roughly as follows: subdivide
the domain logicall into two or more parts, creating mazes in the 
sub-parts, then drawing dividing lines between them with some holes.
The holes in the dividing lines should be constructed so that the
sub-parts form a tree, with exactly one way to get from one of the
sub-parts to any one of the others. Then an optional outer boundary
with optional holes is drawn to finish the maze.
